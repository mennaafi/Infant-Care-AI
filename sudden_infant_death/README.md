## Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) 

ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is a serious infant health concern, often linked to unsafe sleeping positions. This project fine-tunes the **YOLOv11** model on a **custom Roboflow dataset** to detect infant sleep positions.

The dataset was **annotated and preprocessed** on **Roboflow**, including **augmentation** techniques to improve model performance. The model was trained on two key classes:  
- `baby-lying-on-stomach`  
- `baby-lying-on-back`  

The trained model is deployed for **real-time predictions** to assist in infant sleep monitoring.
